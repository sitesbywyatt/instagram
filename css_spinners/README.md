# CSS Spinners

A collection of pure CSS loading spinners—no JavaScript required. Each spinner is built with CSS animations and can be dropped into any project.

## Spinners

| # | Name | Description |
|---|------|-------------|
| 1 | **Bouncing Dots** | Three dots that bounce in sequence for a friendly loading indicator |
| 2 | **Ring Spinner** | A classic circular ring that rotates for a clean, minimal look |
| 3 | **Pulse Loader** | A single element that pulses in and out for a subtle effect |
| 4 | **Dual Ring** | Two rings rotating in opposite directions for a more dynamic feel |
| 5 | **Spinning Square** | A square that spins with a dashed border for a bold, geometric style |

## Usage

Include `spinners.css` and use the corresponding class on a container:

```html
